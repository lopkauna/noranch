Hi this is little helpy program i use my self. Writen on Godot v 4.2.

This editor can help you organize your work or mind flow.

Useful functions (good to know):
1)You can change default binds for programm in options menu.
2)You can add tags to your notes with right mouse click.
3)Noranch support Drag and Drop images in programm window. This will create new note.
4)System crashes and power outage doesnt kill all your progress.
5)Rescent saved note trees would show up in main menu left up corner.

Planning to add in futer builds:
 - Converting note tree in JSON out file
 - Mega note tree shots (Making one large image from note tree)
 - Make one note paste standart (so you can just drag and drop notes to your desktop)
 - Make sticky notes that stay on your desktop background
