Hi this is little helpy program i use my self. Writen on Godot v 4.2.

This editor can help you organize your work or mind flow.

Useful functions (good to know):
 - You can change default binds for programm in options menu.
 - You can add tags to your notes with right mouse click.
 - Noranch support Drag and Drop images in programm window. This will create new note.
 - System crashes and power outage doesnt kill all your progress.
 - Rescent saved note trees would show up in main menu left up corner.

Planning to add in futer builds:
 - Converting note tree in JSON out file
 - Mega note tree shots (Making one large image from note tree)
 - Make one note paste standart (so you can just drag and drop notes to your desktop)
 - Make sticky notes that stay on your desktop background
